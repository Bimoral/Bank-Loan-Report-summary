Bank Loan Report Summary
📘 What the Project Does

The Bank Loan Report Summary is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze loan portfolio performance, track default trends, and evaluate credit risk exposure.
It provides financial institutions and microfinance banks with a clear overview of loan activities — from disbursement to repayment — helping management make data-driven lending decisions.

Key features include:

Loan default analysis by state, loan type, and customer profile

Credit risk heatmaps to identify high-risk borrowers

KPI tracking for loan disbursement, repayment rate, and turnaround time

Dynamic filters and drill-downs for better insights

💡 Why the Project Is Useful

Financial institutions often struggle with:

High loan default rates

Inefficient manual loan tracking processes

Lack of timely insight into loan performance

This dashboard solves those challenges by:

Visualizing loan risk trends for faster intervention

Improving decision-making with real-time insights

Reducing default exposure through better data visibility

Supporting compliance with clear, auditable reports

It’s especially useful for banks, fintechs, and microfinance institutions that want to optimize their loan portfolios and strengthen risk management.
